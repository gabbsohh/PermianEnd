Hi, this is for anyone attempting to place more enemies into the level.
When placing the enemy prefab into the level, please replace the "Player Health" value inside the Enemy Combat Script component.
You can do this by dragging the player that's already placed in the level (NOT THE ONE IN THE PREFABS FOLDER) onto the value and it should be fixed.
This is required for your newly placed enemy to actually damage the player. If you need any assistance, contact me on Discord and i'll help you.
If you know how to fix this, contact me anyways so I can implement said fix. thx
